## Cloud Foundry Droplet Buildpack

This build pack allows you to push a downloaded Cloud Foundry application droplet to different target. It will detects the droplet archive and extract into the new droplet container's application path. This is an alternative approach to uploading a downloaded droplet via the Cloud Foundry API.
